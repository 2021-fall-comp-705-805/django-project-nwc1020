# Nick Cardin Task List for Comp705 Project

- [x] Develop front end a bit and make it look nice

- [x] implement third party api call(amadeus flight offers)(far as i can tell doesnt have a way to call easily in jquery but DOES has a python way to call it, will look more though)

- [ ] implment my own restful api

- [x] heroku deployment

- [x] get authentication working

- [x] make models for user default airports

- [x] figure out how to display user default airport on homepage consistently

- [x] get data back from front end on homepage to get backend to make api call to flight offers

- [ ] save the user search data under my own database in order to make my own restful api

- [x] find a good way to represent user search back to them on the frontend

- [ ] (maybe) check to see if theres a way to select all applicable airports from the flight offers api and use that list for maybe both the deafult airports that users can choose from as well as the list that shows up on the home page. would also end up fixing getting the user default to show up consistently

- [x] get online storage solution put up for heroku deployment

- [x] setup mailgun to be able to actually send out emails - note for this, i was able to get it working but due to me not having a domain to spare for mailgun, i have to use the sandbox which requires me to manually specify who i can send out emails to, so while it works it only works on who i specify

- [x] Have a way for users to set a default airport of their choice (starting with 5-6 major airports)
